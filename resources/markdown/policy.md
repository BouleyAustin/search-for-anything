# Privacy Policy of SearchPod.io
 
_Last updated: February 15, 2022_

This is the privacy policy (“Policy”) of ABTrades LLC (a Texas business corporation) (“we” or “us”) that applies to users of TheImpeccableStockSoftware, a Software-as-a-Service application that we make available at www.searchpod.io (this application referred to here as the “Service”). 

This Policy describes the ways that the Service collects, uses and discloses personally identifiable information (“PII”) that relates to you, the user of the Service. The Policy applies to PII that we collect ourselves as well as PII that is collected about you by third-parties with which we work.

This Policy does not apply to PII that:
we collect in ways other than through the Service, including on any other website that we or a third party operate; or
any third party may collect, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible via the Service.

By visiting, accessing or using the Service or any content that we provide through the Service, you agree to our collection and use of PII as this Policy describes. This Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Service after any modification means that you acknowledge the change and agree to the practices that we disclose in the Policy.
 
PII That You Manually Provide Us

The PII that we collect on or through the Service may include:

Information that you enter into forms on the Service. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use the Service as well as manually submitted into the Service’s search interface. We may also ask you for information you report a problem with the Service.
Records and copies of your correspondence (including email addresses), if you contact us.
Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes.
Details of transactions that you carry out through the Service and of the fulfillment of your orders. You may be required to provide financial information before placing an order through the Service.
In these ways, we may ask you for your name, fictional user name, email address, phone number and other contact information, photographs, payment information, and information about how you have used the Service.

PII That We Collect Automatically


As you use the Service, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect information about your equipment and browsing actions. These may include:
Details of your visits to the Service, including traffic data, location data, logs, and the resources that you access and use on the Service.
Information about your computer or device and Internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type.
We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).
We collect this information to help us understand how people use the Service, how we can improve its speed, how we can make it easier for people to use it and in some cases to advertise the Service or other products that we offer. The technologies we use for automatic data collection may include:
